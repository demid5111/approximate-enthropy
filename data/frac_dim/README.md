# Test data files naming convention

Each file is called:
```bash
<type_of_signal>_<amplitude>_<number_of_points>.
```

Example:
real_data_1_N_401 - real heart beat data that contains 401 points;
sinus_ampl_8_N_300 - sinus signal with amplitude equal 8 and 300 points

> Note: if `<amplitude>` is random it means that amplitude is a function
> from a random argument
